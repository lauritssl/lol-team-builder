  <h1 class="c-article__title">About the League of Bravery Team Builder</h1>

  <p> This website was created as a response to the immense popularity gained by the "Ultimate Bravery" game mode, among a group consisting of me and my friends. We currently have a skype chat with 24 people who play it together on a regular basis - and the more people we can spread it to, the better! However, while playing we encountered one fundamental flaw with the existing alternatives: people are generally cowards - and cowards cheat!
  This trait was particularly strong in our friend <a href="http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/19111404">Mefune</a> who just "happened" to roll a fantastic build every single time. So Mefune is in effect the true reason for this website, since he infuriated 23 people enough to make sure he was in fact being ultimately brave!</p>
